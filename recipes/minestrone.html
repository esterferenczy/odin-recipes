<h2>Italian Minestrone Soup</h2>
<p><em>Italian Minestrone Soup takes just 15 minutes prep time and is loaded with healthy vegetables and a rich, flavorful broth. It also freezes well!</em></p>
<p>Translating to “thick vegetable soup”, minestrone evolved to include meat and a variety of vegetables as they became more widely available. This evolution reflects the variety of recipe versions and adaptability over centuries.</p>
